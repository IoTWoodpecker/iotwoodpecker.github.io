### Introduction 

I am an introduction. I will be written once the report is complete. I will be thoughtful, insightful, and less than 150 words. People will probably still skip me. I am so lonely. Nobody loves an introduction. 

Wait, I'm not even an introduction. I'm just the placeholder of an introduction - and I will definitely be deleted unless something goes terribly wrong. That's even worse! I'm just going to break down. Nobody will ever truly know me. I'm just a shame, waiting to be replaced. 
Congratulations, you just gave a piece of placeholder copy an existential crisis. 

You monster.
